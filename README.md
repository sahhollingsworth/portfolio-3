# Portfolio
This another version of my web development portfolio, built to be lightweight, responsive, and mobile first. It includes developer's contact information, links to the developer's professional websites, a display of projects, and the ability to download a PDF of my resume.

This 3rd portfolio also serves as an exploration of Bootstrap.
